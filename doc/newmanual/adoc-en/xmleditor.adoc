= How to edit the layout file

The layout file is encoded in standard XML (UTF-8) and therefore it can be edited with any text editor (notepad++ for example). We provide a full RelaxNG grammar which makes editing the layout XML with a good XML editor a breeze. We know of the following editors that allow XML editing with the support of RelaxNG. If you know of any other XML editors with RelaxNG support, please drop us a note at info@speedata.de.

 * OxygenXML (Mac, Windows, Linux)
 * XMLSpy (Windows)
 * XML Blueprint (Windows only)
 * GNU Emacs with nxml-mode (all operating systems, free)
 * jEdit (Mac, Windows, Linux, free)

The schema for editing the layout XML can be found in the directory share/schema in the file layoutschema-en.rng.
