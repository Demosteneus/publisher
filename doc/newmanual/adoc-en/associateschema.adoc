= Associate XML editor with schema

Most XML editors can provide useful input support with RELAX NG schema or with XML schema (see <<ch-schemavalidation>>).

The idea is basically always the same: either you assign a schema file to the speedata namespace (`urn:speedata.de:2009/publisher/en`) in principle, or you link each file to the schema separately.

include::oxygenxmlschema.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Atom

For the ((Atom)) editor, the package is called `language-speedata-publisher`. Installation instructions can be found on the github page at https://github.com/speedata/atom-schema-speedata.
