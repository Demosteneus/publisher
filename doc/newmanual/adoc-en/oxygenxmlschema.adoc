The editor https://www.oxygenxml.com[oXygen XML] is a special XML editor that provides excellent support for editing the layout rules.
To get this support, the schema must be assigned to the speedata layout namespace (`urn:speedata.de:2009/publisher/en`).

.In the settings you select the assignment of the document types (Document Type Association). Then click on "New" to create a new association

.In the first tab you have to click on the '+' to create an assignment.

.In this window you enter the namespace of the layout (`urn:speedata.de:2009/publisher/en`).

.Now you can set RELAX NG + Schematron and select the scheme. In the ZIP file it is located under `share/schema/layoutschema-en.rng` or `...-de.rng`, depending on the desired language for the short description.

From now on, for every layout in the namespace

[source, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xmlns="urn:speedata.de:2009/publisher/en"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the schema should be associated with the layout.
This can be checked by the fact that a selection of commands now appears when you enter an opening angle bracket (<).

.If the scheme is correctly integrated, a selection list appears as soon as a command is entered.
