The output of colors in speedata Publisher is very simple. Usually one specification for the object to be output is sufficient:

[source, xml,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <PlaceObject column="4" row="4">
      <Circle
         radiusx="2"
         backgroundcolor="deeppink"
         framecolor="mediumaquamarine"
         rulewidth="8pt"/>
    </PlaceObject>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.Not every colour combination is beautiful

The colors can also be specified as hexadecimal values, as with HTML. The three or six digit value must be preceded by a double cross, for example: ...color="#FF1393".

If you want to output colors in a different color space (CMYK, gray, spot colors), they must be defined first:


[source, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<DefineColor name="logocolor" model="spotcolor"
             colorname="PANTONE 116 C" />

<Record element="data">
  <PlaceObject>
    <Box width="5" height="2" backgroundcolor="logocolor"/>
  </PlaceObject>
</Record>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.Various spot colors are predefined in the Publisher, such as the Pantone 116 color.

If a separate spot color is defined that is not yet included in the Publisher, CMYK values must be specified so that a replacement can be displayed in the PDF. Spot colors are unknown in the PDF and are only available as instructions for the printer. Therefore, the PDF must also contain instructions on how to output this color on screen or on printers that do not contain this spot color.

[source, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<DefineColor
    name="mycolor"
    model="spotcolor"
    colorname="speedatagreen"
    c="56" m="7" y="98" k="21" />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here a color is defined which is addressed in the Publisher with the output commands under the name mycolor. In the PDF this colour is called speedatagreen and in the output it appears in a dark green.

.The new color appears in the PDF as a separate color channel
