<div class="note">This section only applies if you have downloaded the publisher from the web or if you are using the Linux virtual machine we provide.</div>

The speedata Publisher is a server based software and is run via the command line. In the virtual machine use the following button to open a terminal window.

In Mac OS X run Terminal.app which is located in Applications/Utilities. In Windows you klick on the windows button and type in @cmd.exe@ in the search box.

Once you have a terminal window open, you can run the speedata Publisher with the command @sp@. The description of the command is written in the "section about the command line":commandline.html.

The speedata Publisher expects the data XML file with the name @data.xml@ and the layout XML with the name @layout.xml@ (this can be changed) in the current directory or any of its subdirectories. This search path can be extended by configuring the publisher (see the section on "how to configure the speedata publisher":configuration.html). In the virtual machine this is already done and the directory @/home/speedata/Desktop/speedata@ and is subdirectories is added to the search path.
