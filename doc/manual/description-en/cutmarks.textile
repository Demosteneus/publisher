h1. Crop marks

With no special settings, the speedata publisher creates a PDF that has exactly the size of the given pages. If you need to add trim space or crop marks, you need to set them in the "Options":../commands-en/options.html:

{% highlight xml %}
<Options
  cutmarks="yes"
  trim="3mm"/>
{% endhighlight %}

This instruction creates crop marks that have a length of 1cm and are 3mm from the inner page border apart (TrimBox). The distance is denoted by the trim parameter above. The trim parameter has a minimum value of 5pt if given.

The generated PDF file always contains the following PDF boxes: the surrounding box is the __MediaBox__, the given trim is marked by the __BleedBox__ and the page itself is surrounded tightly by the __TrimBox__. If no trim is given, the __BleedBox__ and the __TrimBox__ have the same size. If no crop marks are output, the __MediaBox__ is the same as the __TrimBox__. That way, in neither @cutmarks@ are displayed nor @trim@ has a size greater than 0, all three boxes have the same size.

h2. Example

In the following example the crop marks go to the blue line, that has the dimensions of the trim length. The green line shows the regular page dimensions (screenshot from Adobe Acrobat).
