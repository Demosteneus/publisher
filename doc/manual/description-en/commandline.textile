h2. Description of the command line parameters

- @--autoopen@:= Opens the PDF file after running the publisher. Can also be set in the "configuration file":configuration.html.
- @--data=NAME@:= Name of the data XML file. Default is  @data.xml@. Can be set in the "configuration file":configuration.html. If the file name is a dash (@-@), the speedata publisher reads the XML data from standard input (STDIN).
- @--dummy@ := Only read the layout rules. A simple data file is assumed which only contains one element: @<data />@. This is for quick testing of layout files.
- @-x@, @--extra-dir@ := Puts the given directory into the search path. All assets (images, fonts, XML data and layout rules) must be found in the seach path, which will be traversed recursively. This parameter can be given multiple times and preset in the "configuration file":configuration.html.
- @--filter=FILTER@ := Run the given XPROC file.
- @--grid@ := Show the grid. Can be turned off with @--no-grid@.  Can be configured in the layout XML file: "Layout":../commands-en/options.html.
- @--layout=NAME@:= Name of the layout XML file. Default is @layout.xml@. Can be "configured":configuration.html.
- @--[no-]local@ := The current directory is (not) added to the search path recursively. The default is @--local@ which means that the currenct directory and all its subdirectories is added to the search path. This allows you to run the publisher in any directory and put your assets in a subdirectory.
- @--jobname=NAME@ := The name of the output file. Default is @publisher@. The extension (@.pdf@) is added automatcially.
- @--outputdir=DIR@ := Name of the directory of the resulting file. The directory will be created if necessary.
- @--runs=NUM@ := The number of passes. Normally the publisher will process a file only once, but more passes can be necessary if intermediate files are created for generating a table of contents or other document dependent data.
- @--show-gridallocation@ := Show the allocated grid cells in yellowish color and double allocated grid cells in red.
- @--startpage=NUM@ := The number of the first page.
- @-v@, @--var=value@ := Passes additional variables to the publisher run. The variables can be accessed as usual with @select="$variable"@.
- @--verbose@ := More inforation than necessary.
- @--wd=DIR@ := Change working directory. Exactly the same as if you'd cd into that directory before running @sp@.
- @--xml@:= The output of some commands (currently only @list-fonts@) will be printed in (pseudo) XML. That way the output can be re-used in the layout XML.


h2. Commands

- @list-fonts@ := Lists all fonts that are found in the search path. Together with @--xml@ the output format can re used in the layout XML.
- @compare@ := Recursivly check a directory for layout changes. See the topic "about quality assurance":qualityassurance.html.
- @clean@ := Remove temporary files from the publisher run. Keeps the PDF file.
- @doc@ := Opens the HTML documentation.
- @run@ := Starts the pseedata publisher (this is the default command).
- @watch@ := Runs in internal hotfolder mode.

h3. Example for hotfolder configuration

pre. [hotfolder]
hotfolder = /home/speedata/hotfolder
events = layout\.xml:run(runpublisher);data\.xml:run(runpublisher)

- @hotfolder@ := Directory to be watched.
- @events@ := Entries (separated by a semicolon) in the form @pattern:command@. The @puster@ is a regular expression. If this pattern matches a file, the command given in the configuration is executed. Currently only external programs can be run. These programs must be given in parentheses. The path to the file will be passed as the first argument. The hotfolder waits until the program is finished and removes the file afterwards.
