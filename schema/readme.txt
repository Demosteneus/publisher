README for the schema directory
===============================

The english RelaxNG schema is now the official one, although the element names 
and attributes are still subject to change (there are probably better translation 
then the ones I came up with).

Don't edit the other Schema files. Edit the translation file (translation.xml) 
and run the transformation given below.

sdcontrol --update-schemafiles
